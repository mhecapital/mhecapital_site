  <h1>Daily Desk – November 25, 2025</h1>
  <p class="small">
    Broad risk assets extend Monday’s Fed-cut-driven rebound, with Asia and Europe trading cautiously higher while markets brace for a heavy US data batch (PPI, retail sales, housing) that can recalibrate December rate-cut odds.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Macro Context &amp; Sentiment</h2>
  <div class="section-box">
    <ul>
      <li>Asian equities trade mostly higher, supported by renewed expectations of a December Fed cut after Wall Street’s strong Monday session; Japan and broader Asian indices are green, while India is choppy around key highs.</li>
      <li>US and European rates markets price a softer growth path with rising odds of a December Fed cut; the US curve remains inverted while 10Y yields ease and the dollar consolidates, as EUR/USD trades sideways near 1.15 after flat German GDP.</li>
      <li>Equities have bounced sharply: Monday saw the S&amp;P 500 up ~1.6% and Nasdaq ~2.6%, led by big tech, while the VIX has slipped back toward the low-20s after last week’s spike above 26, signalling calmer but still nervous positioning into key US data.</li>
      <li>Gold remains in a consolidation phase after briefly trading above $4,100 earlier this month; oil is steady as supply risks balance demand worries, and crypto markets are stabilizing after last week’s broad risk-off washout that hit Bitcoin and high-beta assets.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>2. Long-Term Trend – US Indices</h2>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Index</th><th>LT Bias</th><th>Structure</th><th>Risks</th></tr>

    <tr>
      <td>S&amp;P 500 (ES)</td>
      <td>Bullish (corrective phase)</td>
      <td>Holds a series of higher weekly lows after a sharp AI-led correction; current action looks like a pullback within a broader uptrend, with the recent dip bought aggressively on Fed-cut expectations.</td>
      <td>Hawkish repricing if US inflation re-accelerates, deeper earnings downgrades for 2026, or a renewed spike in VIX back above mid-20s.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Nasdaq 100 (NQ)</td>
      <td>Bullish but fragile</td>
      <td>Trades in a distribution range after an AI-driven boom-and-bust; breadth is narrow and leadership concentrated, making the index sensitive to macro surprises and single-name tech headlines.</td>
      <td>Valuation compression on higher real yields, rotation out of mega-cap tech, and any disappointment on AI capex or regulation.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Dow Jones (YM)</td>
      <td>Neutral / slightly bullish</td>
      <td>Benefits from rotation into value, industrials and financials; structure is cleaner than NQ with shallower pullbacks, but remains tied to global growth momentum.</td>
      <td>Growth slowdown in the US and abroad, industrial earnings misses, and renewed stress in financials if credit spreads widen again.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>3. US Open Focus – Intraday Playbook</h2>
  <p class="small"><strong>Logic:</strong> US index futures trade slightly above Monday’s close after a strong two-day rebound; intraday direction is likely to be driven by reactions around prior-day extremes and liquidity pockets once US PPI/retail sales hit, with traders watching for either continuation of the squeeze or a fade back into last week’s range.</p>

  <table>
    <tr><th>Index</th><th>Bias</th><th>Support</th><th>Liquidity Zone</th><th>Scenario</th></tr>

    <tr>
      <td>ES</td>
      <td><span class="dot dot-n"></span> neutral</td>
      <td>Prior day low / overnight low area as first demand band; deeper support near last week’s volume node where the rebound started.</td>
      <td>Cluster of liquidity above Monday’s high and around the weekly VWAP / prior swing high.</td>
      <td>Base case: early probe above Monday high; if that break fails (wick + absorption), look for a rotation back toward the middle of yesterday’s range. Clean acceptance above Monday high opens path to a trend-up day into remaining shorts; loss of prior day low brings back risk-off flows and favors mean-reversion shorts.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>NQ</td>
      <td><span class="dot dot-n"></span> neutral</td>
      <td>Support around the prior liquidation zone from last week’s tech selloff and Monday’s intraday pullback low.</td>
      <td>Liquidity resting above prior day high where breakout buyers and late shorts are trapped.</td>
      <td>Watch for a stop-run above prior day high: failed breakout with divergence vs ES/YM favors short back into range; if ES/YM confirm strength and NQ holds above the breakout zone, momentum longs can ride an extension with tight risk below reclaimed levels.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>YM</td>
      <td><span class="dot dot-g"></span> bullish</td>
      <td>Tight support band from Thursday–Monday lows, where dip buyers stepped in during the recent correction.</td>
      <td>Liquidity sitting just above Monday’s high and around weekly mid-range.</td>
      <td>Rotation/value bid still supports YM; look for pullbacks into support to build longs targeting a grind higher as long as ES does not break down. Shift to shorts only if the support cluster fails impulsively and correlation with ES/NQ flips risk-off.</td>

  <h2>5. Gold Focus – GC</h2>
  <div class="section-box">
    <ul>
      <li>Neutral to slightly bullish medium-term bias, but tactically vulnerable intraday as gold consolidates after a huge year-to-date move and a brief spike above $4,100 earlier in November.</li>
      <li>Key zones: recent swing high region as resistance (where supply re-appeared after the breakout) and a support band defined by last week’s pullback lows and the prior consolidation range.</li>
      <li>Main drivers this week: US data (PPI, retail sales, housing, and upcoming PCE) shaping real yields and the USD; Fed communication around December; and the balance between equity volatility (risk-off hedging flows) versus a smooth year-end rally that tends to cap upside.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>6. Elies’ Note</h2>
  <div class="section-box">
    <p>
      Trend is trying to reassert itself after a violent correction, but the tape is still headline driven.<br>
      Let the data drop, watch how indices react around prior day extremes and key liquidity pockets, and avoid forcing trades in the middle of the range.<br>
      Focus on clean structure, controlled risk per trade, and letting winners run only when the orderflow confirms the bias.
